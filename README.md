# neural-network-mnist-recognition
tensor.py is a normal neural network without convolution for mnist recognition. Just for study.
It has 98.9% accuracy in test dataset.

convolution.py is a new file that achieves simple convolution neural network for mnist dataset.   
It can get 99.2% accuracy for test samples.

Environment:tensorflow 1.14 cpu or gpu either is ok and python = 3.7
tensor.py and convolution can run singly with "data" folder
